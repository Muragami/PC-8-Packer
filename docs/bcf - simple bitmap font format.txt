output this font into a standard format: (.bcf)

	The file format is a 8 byte header: 4 character file if, 
	2 bytes that record the amount of characters contained,
	a byte that is the width of the characters,
	a byte that is the height of the characters, as so:

	XXXX XX   X  X  
	BCFF -1   -2 -3 
	BCFV -1   -2 -3 

	BCFF: Binary Character Font Fixed
	BCFV: Binary Character Font Variable (width)

	-1: num characters contained, lower byte first, two bytes (65535 characters allowed)
	-2: width of each character in bits (maximum width for variable width)
	-3: heights of each character in lines
	
BCFF: (fixed width characters)
	After that header in a 'BCFF' id file, we have an array of
	UTF-8 encoded characters, equal to the value [-1] above.

	After that array, there is the character bits in sequence:
		width bits to bytes (round up) x lines bytes per character
		lines top to bottom, lower bytes first

BCFV: (variable width characters)
	After that header in a 'BCFV' id file, we have an array
	of single byte character widths, in length equal to [-1] above bytes.

	After that array, we have an array of
	UTF-8 encoded characters, equal to the value [-1] above.

	After that array, there is the character bits in sequence:
		width bits to bytes (round up) x lines bytes per character
		lines top to bottom, lower bytes first
		
Some simple file format limitations:
	255 width, 255 height character bitmaps
	bitmaps only 1 bit deep, plot or don't plot only
	65535 characters in total
